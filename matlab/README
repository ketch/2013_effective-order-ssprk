The main computation is done in the source directory and the code is called by the files:

1. solve_HCL.m : Solves HCL problems - currently advection, burgers and buckley-leverett. See the beginning of the code for instructions.
2. compute_dtFE_exp.m: Computes experimental dt_FE for the 1st order upwind and second order TVD spatial discretizations (with 3 different limiters for now)
3. observed_ssp_coef.m: Finds the maximal coefficient for an ESSPRK method for which solution remains monotonically decreasing.
4. table_obs_SSP_coef.m: Creates table for observed maximal coefficients.
5. test_method.m: Test the desired order for an ESSPRK method
6. convergence_test.m: Convergence test on various scalar and systems of odes.
7. create_methods.m: Creates all methods.
8. create_method.m: Creates an ESSPRK method.
9. save_method_to_file.m: Saves method to a text file - for shapclaw.
10. table_of_method_coeff.m: Creates latex code for the coefficients of a method.



Commands for creating figures as appear in paper:

1. For convergence figures run:
>> convergence_test('vdp',3)
>> convergence_test('vdp',4)
Open the eps file with a text editor and set:
%%BoundingBox:    40   165   555   595
to reduce the redundant white space at the boundaries.
Note that BoundingBox is defined as x1 y1 x2 y2.


2. For Burgers' equation with continuous initial data run:
>> solve_HCL('burgers','ESSPRK442','cont',0,2,1.6253,200,1,0)
Open the eps file with a text editor and set:
%%BoundingBox:    47   175   537   600
to reduce the redundant white space at the boundaries.

Set coef = 1.60 and run again:
>> solve_HCL('burgers','ESSPRK442','cont',0,2,1.6213,200,1,0)

Zoom in the area where oscillations appear and save the magnified snapshot.
Make sure that the axis are scaled in a similar fashion as in the continuous case.
Open the eps file with a text editor and set:
%%BoundingBox:    47   175   537   600
to reduce the redundant white space at the boundaries.


3. For Burgers' equation with discontinuous initial data run:
>> solve_HCL('burgers','ESSPRK542','discont',0,2,.60554,200,1,0)
Open the eps file with a text editor and set:
%%BoundingBox:    35   175   540   600

Set coef = 2.15 and run again:
>> solve_HCL('burgers','ESSPRK542','discont',0,2,.602,200,1,0)

Zoom in the area where oscillations appear and save the magnified snapshot.
Make sure that the axis are scaled in a similar fashion as in the continuous case.
Open the eps file with a text editor and set:
%%BoundingBox:    30   175   535   600
to reduce the redundant white space at the boundaries.
