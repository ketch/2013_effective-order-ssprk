    In this work we apply the algebraic theory of Runge--Kutta methods and specifically the concept of effective order to strong stability preserving Runge--Kutta methods.  These methods of effective order satisfy relaxed order conditions when combined with special starting
    and stopping methods. We construct such methods up to effective order four and establish their optimality (many methods achieve a previously theoretical upper bound on the SSP coefficient).  In particular, we present four-stage effective order four SSP RK methods which is not possible with four stages using classical order. Numerical experiments demonstrate the feasibility of
    effective order in practice. We prove that methods of effective order five cannot have strictly positive weights $b$. A direct corollary is the non-existence of effective order five SSP methods.
