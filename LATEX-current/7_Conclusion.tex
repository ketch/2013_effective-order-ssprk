\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:Conclusion}
We used the theory of strong stability preserving time discretizations
with Butcher's algebraic interpretation of order to construct
effective order SSP Runge--Kutta (ESSPRK) methods. 
These methods, when accompanied by starting and finishing 
schemes, attain an order of accuracy higher than their (classical) order.
We proved that explicit Runge--Kutta methods with strictly positive 
weights have at most fourth effective order. 
This extends the barrier already known in the case of classical order
explicit SSPRK methods.
%This generates a barrier for explicit effective order SSP methods.

ESSPRK methods of effective order three and four
were constructed by numerical optimization
and we studied their SSP 
properties in comparison with the classical SSPRK methods.
% for linear and nonlinear problems.
Most of the methods found were optimal because they achieved
the upper bound on the SSP coefficient known from linear
problems.
%We were able to find families of third effective order ESSPRK methods. 
Also, despite the non-existence of four-stage, four-order explicit SSPRK methods, 
we found fourth effective order methods with four stages (of classical 
order two and three). 

We proposed a new choice of starting and finishing methods to allow the 
overall procedure to be SSP.

\sout{
The starting method not only perturbs but also advances the solution
by a single time-step.
Then the main ESSPRK method carries out most
of the computation: $n-2$ time-steps.
For the final step, a correction is applied using the finishing method.
The starting and finishing methods impose minimal additional computational cost as
they contain at most two more stages than those of the main method.
}

Finally, we performed numerical tests which confirmed the accuracy and
SSP properties of the ESSPRK methods.
Interestingly, compared to what is observed with standard SSPRK schemes,
there was much closer agreement between the (theoretical) stability limit
given by the SSP coefficient and that observed in practice
(e.g., when measuring total variation of solutions of Burgers' equation).

The ideas here were applied to explicit Runge--Kutta methods, but they
could also be applied to other classes of methods including implicit
Runge--Kutta methods, general linear methods, and Rosenbrock methods.
