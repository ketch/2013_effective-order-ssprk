TODO list for effective order paper
===================================

* conclusion & abstract

* fix proofs

* Colin: think about the R&T OCs

* Use R and rho not P in section 5.  (P was already used and doesn't go with rho anyway)

* double-check all \alpha\beta and BA orderings are correct.  Section 1,2,3 should be done.

* some bib entries are in need of attention.  [LATER]

* most bib entries do not have abbreviated/full JOURNAL/FJOURNAL (see Shu/Osher1988)  [LATER]
