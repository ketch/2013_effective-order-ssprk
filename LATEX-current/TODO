TODO list for effective order paper
===================================

* are we sure about this tighter SSP coef vs experimental TVD result?

    * Perhaps we should make a table a la [Ketcheson, Gottlieb,
      Macdonald 2011].  As David suggests, maybe with a second-order
      scheme in space.

    * Intro to section 6 says "accurately meaures"...


* some bib entries are in need of attention.

* most bib entries do not have abbreviated/full JOURNAL/FJOURNAL (see Shu/Osher1988)
