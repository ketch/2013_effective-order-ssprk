\section{Strong stability preserving Runge--Kutta methods}\label{sec:SSP}
Strong stability preserving (SSP) time-stepping methods were originally introduced
for time integration of systems of hyperbolic conservation laws
\cite{Shu/Osher:1988} 
\begin{align}\label{eq:pde}
	\bm{U}_t + \nabla \cdot \bm{f}(\bm{U}) = 0,   
\end{align}
with appropriate initial and boundary conditions.
A spatial discretization gives the system of ODEs
\begin{align}\label{eq:ode_system}
    \bm{u}'(t) = \bm{F}(\bm{u}(t)),
\end{align}
where $\bm{u}$ is a vector of continuous-in-time grid values approximating 
the solution $\bm{U}$ at discrete grid points.
Of course, \eqref{eq:ode_system} can arise in many ways and $\bm{F}$
need not necessarily represent a spatial discretization.
Particularly, $\bm{F}$ may be time-dependent, but we can always make a 
transformation to an autonomous form.
In any case, a time discretization then produces a sequence of
solutions $\bm{u}^{n} \approx \bm{u}(t_n)$.
This work studies explicit Runge--Kutta time discretizations.
An explicit $s$-stage Runge--Kutta method takes the form
\begin{align*}
	\bm{u}^{n+1} &= \bm{u}^{n} + \Dt \sum_i^s b_i \bm{F}(\bm{Y}_i), 
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
	\bm{Y}_i &= \bm{u}^{n} + \Dt \sum_j^{i-1} a_{ij} \bm{F}(\bm{Y}_j).
\end{align*}
Such methods are characterized by the coefficient matrix $A = (a_{ij}) \in 
\mathbb{R}^{s \times s}$, the weight vector $\bm{b} = (b_i) \in \mathbb{R}^s$
and the abscissa $\bm{c} = (c_i) \in \mathbb{R}^s$, where 
$c_i = \sum_{j=1}^{i-1}a_{ij}$.
The accuracy and stability of the method depend on the coefficients of the 
Butcher tableau $(A,\bm{b},\bm{c})$ \cite{Butcher2008_book}.

In some cases, the solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws satisfy a 
monotonicity property. For example, if \eqref{eq:pde} is scalar then solutions 
are monotonic in the total variation semi-norm \cite{Ketcheson2008}.
% probably should be a ref about HCLs (not SSP) but good enough for now
For this reason, many popular spatial discretizations are designed such 
that, for a suitable class of problems, the solution $\bm{u}$ in 
\eqref{eq:ode_system} computed with the forward Euler scheme is
non-increasing (in time) in some norm, semi-norm, or convex functional; i.e.,
\begin{align}\label{eq:forwardEuler}
    \|\bm{u} + \Dt\bm{F}(\bm{u})\| \le \|\bm{u}\|, \quad \text{for all } \bm{u} \text{ and for } 0 \le \Dt \le \DtFE.
\end{align}
Note that $\DtFE$ is a property of $\bm{F}$ (and is independent of $\bm{u}$).
If this is the case, then an SSP method also generates a solution whose norm is
non-increasing in time, under a modified time-step restriction.
\begin{definition}[Strong Stability Preserving]
	A Runge--Kutta method is said to be \emph{strong stability preserving} with
	\emph{SSP coefficient} $\sspcoef > 0$ if, whenever the forward Euler condition
	\eqref{eq:forwardEuler} holds and 
	\begin{align*}
		0 \leq \Dt \leq \sspcoef \DtFE,
	\end{align*}
	the Runge--Kutta method generates a monotonic sequence of solution values $\bm{u}^n$ satisfying
	\begin{align*}
  		\|\bm{u}^{n+1}\| \le \|\bm{u}^n\|.
	\end{align*}
\end{definition}

The SSP coefficient $\sspcoef$ is a property of the particular
time-stepping method and quantifies the allowable time step size relative 
to that of the forward Euler method.
Generally we want the SSP coefficient to be as large as possible for efficiency.
To allow a fair comparison of different explicit methods, we consider the 
\emph{effective SSP coefficient}
\begin{align*}
	\ceff = \frac{\sspcoef}{s}.
\end{align*}
Note that the use of the word \emph{effective} here is unrelated to the 
concept of \emph{effective order} introduced in Section~\ref{sec:Algebraic_RK}.


\subsection{Optimal SSP schemes}\label{subsec:Optimal_SSPRK}
We say that an SSP Runge--Kutta method is optimal if it has the largest 
possible SSP coefficient for a given order and a given number of stages.
The search for these optimal methods was originally based on
expressing the Runge--Kutta method as combinations of forward Euler
steps (the Shu--Osher form) and solving a non-linear optimization
problem \cite{Gottlieb/Shu:1998, Gottlieb2001, Spiteri2003a, Spiteri2003b, 
Ruuth2004, Ruuth:2006}.
However, the SSP coefficient is related to the 
\emph{radius of absolute monotonicity} \cite{Kraaijevanger1991} and, 
for irreducible Runge--Kutta methods, the two are equivalent 
\cite{Ferracina2004, Higueras2004}.
This gives a simplified algebraic characterization of the SSP coefficient
\cite{Ferracina2005}; it is the maximum value of $r$ such that the following
conditions hold:
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:absmon}
\begin{align}
    K(I + rA)^{-1} \geq 0 \\
    \bm{e}_{s+1} - rK(I + rA)^{-1}\bm{e}_{s} \geq 0,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
provided that $I + rA$ is invertible.
Here
\begin{equation*}
    K = \left(
            \begin{array}{c}
                     A              \\
                     \bm{b}^{\texttt{T}}
            \end{array}
         \right),
\end{equation*}
while $\bm{e}_s$ denotes the vector of ones of length $s$ and $I$ is the
$s \times s$ identity matrix.
The inequalities are understood component-wise.

The optimization problem of finding optimal SSP Runge--Kutta methods
can thus be written as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SSP_opt}
    \max_{A, \bm{b}, r} \; r \quad \text{subject to} \quad 
                                           \text{\eqref{eq:absmon} and } \Phi(K) = 0.
\end{equation}
Here \( \Phi(K) \) represents the  order conditions.

Following \cite{Ketcheson2008, Ketcheson/Macdonald/Gottlieb:2009}, 
we will numerically solve the optimization problem \eqref{eq:SSP_opt} to find
optimal effective order explicit SSP Runge--Kutta methods.
However, we first need to define the order conditions $\Phi(K)$ for methods
of effective order.
This is discussed in the next section.
