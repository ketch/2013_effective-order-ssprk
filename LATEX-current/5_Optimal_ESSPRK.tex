\section{Optimal effective order SSP Runge-Kutta schemes}\label{sec:Optimal_ESSPRK}
In this section we use the effective order conditions to
construct an SSP main method $M$ and its corresponding starting and finishing
methods $S,S^{-1}$.  Methods $S$ and $S^{-1}$ are not generally SSP, but we
explain how the resulting scheme can be reinterpreted so that they are.

We now rely on the SSP theory and the Butcher's theory of effective order,
previously reviewed in Sections \ref{sec:SSP} and \ref{sec:Algebraic_RK}, to
find optimal explicit SSP Runge-Kutta schemes with prescribed effective and classical order.
explicit SSPRK method.  Due to Corollary~\ref{cor:no-ssp-5}, we need only consider
methods with effective order up to four.

Recall from Section~\ref{sec:Algebraic_RK} that the methods of effective order involve
a main method $M$ as well as starting and finishing methods $S,S^{-1}$.
Note (from Table~\ref{tab:Effective_oc}) that the conditions for the main method $M$
up to order four do not depend on the coefficients $\beta$ of the methods $S,S^{-1}$. 
Therefore, the search for optimal methods of effective order can be carried out in
two steps, first searching for optimal methods $M$ and then for methods $S,S^{-1}$.


We denote by ESSPRK($s,q,p$) an $s$-stage Explicit SSP Runge-Kutta method of
effective order $q$ and classical order $p$. If $q=p$ then we
write simply ESSPRK($s,p$). 

The effective order SSPRK methods found are optimal among all SSPRK methods, since their SSP coefficients either match the threshold factors for linear problems \yianniscomment{see SSPRK(s,3,2)} or are at least equal with the already known SSPRK methods. \yianniscomment{see SSPRK(s,4,2) \& SSPRK(s,4,3)}

\colincomment{I don't think the previous is quite right}

Further more, this combination allows the construction of a
four-stage, effective order four SSPRK scheme and thus in some sense overcomes the
non-existence of an SSPRK(\( 4 \),\( 4 \)) method.  This scheme uses a
four-stage, four-effective SSPRK method of classical order either two
or three, accompanied by specific starting and finishing methods.

\comment{With the exception of the four-effective SSP methods of four and five stages, the effective SSP methods for nonlinear problems have SSP coefficients equal to those for linear problems, hence the upper bound is obtained \cite{Kraaijevanger1986}.}

\subsection{The main method}\label{subsection3.1}
We begin by finding the main method $M$.

The starting and finishing methods can be chosen to be SSPRK methods, resulting
in an SSP Runge-Kutta scheme of higher order.


\subsubsection{The optimisation problem of the main method}\label{subsection3.1.1}

\qquad Our aim is to find the optimal main method that has the largest possible SSP coefficient for nonlinear problems, fixing each time the stage, effective and classical order. 
Assume that the ESSPRK(\( s \),\( q \),\( p \)) method \( M \) has Butcher tableau  \( (A, \bm{b}) \)
and reconsider the optimization problem~\eqref{eqSSPopt}
with \( \Phi_{q,p}(K) \) representing  the conditions for effective order $q$ and classical order $p$.
% \begin{equation}
%     \max_{A, \bm{b}^{\texttt{T}}, r} r, \qquad \text{subject to } \quad \left\{
%                                                  \begin{array}{ll}
%                                                    N \geq 0 \\
%                                                    \textbf{e}_{s+1} - rN\textbf{e}_{s} \geq 0 \\
%                                                    \Phi_{p,q}(K) = 0,
%                                                  \end{array}
%                                                \right.
% \end{equation}

The methods are found through numerical search, using
\textsc{MATLAB}'s optimization toolbox on the above constrained
optimization problem.  Specifically, we use \verb"fmincon" with a
sequential quadratic programming approach.
This process does not guarantee a global minimizer, so several
searches are performed to try to ensure the method with the largest possible SSP coefficient is found.


\subsubsection{SSP coefficients}\label{subsection3.1.2}

The effective SSP coefficients for up to eleven stages are shown in Table \ref{tab:5.1}. For the computation of ESSPRK(\( s \),\( 4 \),\( 3 \)) methods we use the effective order conditions with \( \beta_{3} \neq 0 \). This allows more freedom in the choice of coefficients since less equations must be satisfied. Similarly with SSPRK methods, all effective SSP coefficients of ESSPRK methods have \( c_{ef\!f} < 1 \).

\todo{More explanation of the results of this table, something like the following:}
First row: these are optimal b/c they match the linear bounds.  SSPRK methods up to 11 stages also match these bounds for 3rd order.  Second row: most of these are optimal b/c they match the linear bounds and they are at least as good as the SSPRK (they are all better except (10,4) which is equal).  Third row: still better than SSPRK.

\begin{result}
  ESSPRK have $\sspcoef$ greater than or equal to that of SSPRK.
\end{result}

\begin{result}
  Many of the ESSPRK (including all of those with many stages) we have
  found by numerical search have $\sspcoef$ which achieve the linear
  bound.  This shows they are optimal.  \todo{a list that do not
    achieve the linear bound: ESSPRK(4,4,2) and ESSPRK(5,4,2), 543,

\subsubsection{Three order schemes}\label{subsubsection3.4.1}



% Even though a second order SSPRK method of effective order three is used for the main part of the computation, the \( PM^{n-2}T \) scheme has the same efficiency with a scheme that uses a three-order SSPRK method \( n \) times. Table \ref{table5.2} gives the SSPRK(\( 3 \),\( 3 \),\( 2 \)) scheme and its relevant permutation methods.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm3.1}
  %If we require positive coefficients, an optimal three-stage, third effective order SSP Runge Kutta method of classical order two, is given by
  An \todo{(the?)} optimal family of three-stage, third effective order
  SSP Runge--Kutta methods of classical order two, with SSP
  coefficient $\sspcoef=1$ is given by
    \begin{displaymath}
        \begin{split}
            \bm{Y}_{1} &= \bm{u}^{n} \\
            \bm{Y}_{2} &= \bm{u}^{n} + \Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_{1}) \\
            \bm{Y}_{3} &= \bm{u}^{n} + \gamma\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_{1}) + \gamma\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_{2}) \\
            \bm{u}^{n+1} &= \bm{u}^{n} + \frac{5\gamma-1}{6\gamma}\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_{1}) + \frac{1}{6}\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_{2}) + \frac{1}{6\gamma}\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_{3}),
        \end{split}
    \end{displaymath}
    where \( \gamma > 1/5 \) is a free parameter. We denote the above family as ESSPRK(3,3,2).
\end{theorem}

\todo{TODO: need to check that this really is $\sspcoef=1$ for all values of $\gamma$.}

\begin{proof}
%\todo{show this has $\sspcoef=1$}.
\todo{This is the shortest proof, needs cleaned up a bit}
One can check that this method has $\sspcoef = 1$ and b/c this is the linear bound which has been achieved therefore it is optimal.
\end{proof}


Theorem~\ref{thm3.1} gives an \emph{family} of three-stage methods.
The particular value of $\gamma = \frac{1}{4}$ corresponds to the
usual SSPRK(3,3) method.  We note in Table~\ref{tab:5.1} that
SSPRK(\( s \),\( 3 \),\( 2 \)) methods have the same SSP coefficients
as SSPRK(\( s \),\( 3 \)).  It seems possible that for each $s$, the
ESSPRK($s$, 3, 2) may form a family of which the optimal SSPRK($s$, 3)
is a particular member. {\bf but is the optimal SSPRK($s,3$) unique?}


%\subsection{Constructing optimal higher order SSP Runge-Kutta schemes}\label{subsection3.4}

% \qquad As described in the previous section, using \( n \) times an SSPRK(\( s \),\( q \),\( p \)) method as the main method \( M \) accompanied by the relevant starting and finishing methods \( P \) and \( T \) respectively, the resulting Runge-Kutta scheme \( PM^{n-2}T \) attains order \( q \).

\subsubsection{Fourth order schemes}\label{subsubsection3.4.2}

\begin{result}
  In contrast with the non-existence of SSP(\( 4 \),\( 4 \)) method
  \cite{Gottlieb1998,Ruuth2002}, we were are able to
  find SSPRK(\( 4 \),\( 4 \),\( 2 \)) and SSPRK(\( 4 \),\( 4 \),\( 3
  \)) methods.
\end{result}

Unlike effective three, here ESSPRK methods have generally larger SSP coefficients $\sspcoef$ compared to SSPRK.

%The big advantage comes when we use SSPRK(\( s \),\( 4 \),\( p \)) for method \( M \).

%Then, the corresponding \( PM^{n-2}T \) SSPRK scheme has order four and greater or at least equal SSP coefficients than the SSPRK(\( s \),\( 4 \)) methods.

 Also, for stages \( s > 7 \) the SSP coefficient of SSPRK(\( s \),\( 4 \),\( 2 \)) and SSPRK(\( s \),\( 4 \),\( 3 \)) are the same.

%Their corresponding \( RM^{n-2}T \) schemes are presented in Tables \ref{table5.3} and \ref{table5.4}.

\todo{possible result on ($n^2+1$, 4,2) methods: should not hold up paper waiting for this result.}


\subsubsection{Non-existence of fifth-order schemes}\label{sec:noESSP5}

There is no explicit effective order 5 SSP methods.  This is a corollary of Theorem~\ref{thm:positiveb} and the following lemma.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:ssp_pos_coef}\cite{Ruuth2002}
  \todo{is this also in Kraaijevanger \cite{Kraaijevanger1991}?}
  An SSPRK method
  %with \( \alpha_{ij}, \beta_{ij} \geq 0 \)
  %in the Shu-Osher form
  has Butcher Tableau \( (A,\textbf{b}^{\texttt{T}},\textbf{c}) \) with positive weight coefficients \( \textbf{b} > 0 \).
\end{lem}

\todo{[In this paper, we should remove mentions of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ that refer something other than Butcher's tree stuff]}


\subsection{Starting and finishing methods}\label{subsection3.2}

\todo{$SM$ or $MS$ order: this section isn't updated.}

\subsubsection{Optimization of $ S $ and $ S^{-1} $}\label{subsection3.2.1}

Having constructed an SSPRK(\( s \),\( q \),\( p \)) scheme that can
be used as the main method \( M \), we need to find the perturbation
methods \( S \) and \( S^{-1} \) such that the Runge-Kutta scheme \(
SM^{n}S^{-1} \) attains classical order $q$ (the effective order of
method \( M \)).

To find perturbation methods, we must satisfy a set of order conditions.  In order to reuse our optimization codes, we try to pose a constrained optimization problem.  One approach %to finding perturbation methods
 is to try to minimise the size of the coefficients of the method \( S  = (\hat{A}, \hat{\textbf{b}}^{\texttt{T}}, \hat{\textbf{c}}) \). Therefore, we minimize
\begin{displaymath}
    \|\hat{A}\|_{F} + \|\hat{\textbf{b}}\|_{2},
\end{displaymath}
where \( \|\cdot\|_{F} \) is the Frobenius norm. The optimisation problem becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eq5.2}
    \min_{S} \Bigl(\|\hat{A}\|_{F} + \|\hat{\textbf{b}}\|_{2}\Bigr), \quad \text{subject to } \quad \left\{
                                                                                     \begin{array}{ll}
                                                                                           \Phi_{q}(S^{-1}S) = 0 \\
                                                                                           \widehat{\Phi}_{i}(S) = 0,
                                                                                     \end{array}
                                                                             \right.
\end{equation}
where \( \Phi_{q}(S^{-1}S) \) are the conditions
%so that \( S^{-1}S = I \) up to order \( q \)
so that \( \beta^{-1}\beta(t) = 0 \) for trees up to order \( q \)
 and \( \widehat{\Phi}_{i}(S) = 0 \) represents the order conditions on \( \beta \) in Table~\ref{tab:Effective_oc}.
The number of stages for the perturbation methods depends on the effective and classical order of the main method \( M \). When \( M \) is an SSPRK(\( s \),\( 3 \),\( 2 \)) method we found that the stages of methods \( S \) and \( S^{-1} \) are at least two. We were able to find perturbation methods with only two stages for SSPRK(\( s \),\( 3 \),\( 2 \)) methods up to \( 13 \) stages. Similarly, for four effective order methods \( M \), the perturbation methods appear to need at least four stages. For SSPRK(\( s \),\( 4 \),\( 2 \)) we found four-stages methods \( S \) and \( S^{-1} \) up to \( 17 \) stages and for SSPRK(\( s \),\( 4 \),\( 3 \)) up to \( 22 \) stages. Therefore, the perturbation methods have minimal computational and storage cost, in contrast with their large importance in raising the order of the \( SM^{n}S^{-1} \) scheme from low classical order to higher effective order of method \( M \).

\subsubsection{Alternative starting/stopping procedure}\label{subsection3.2.2}

An important drawback of the previous formulation is that the resulting \( SM^{n}S^{-1} \) Runge-Kutta scheme is not SSP. The conditions \( S^{-1}S = I \) and \( \beta_{1} = 0 \) as lead to \( \beta_{1} = \beta^{-1}_{1} = 0 \) and hence the methods \( S \) and \( S^{-1} \) must satisfy $\sum b_i = 0$.  Thus they cannot be SSP.  \colincomment{I'm not completely sure about this: SSP theory might be different somehow when the step-size is zero.}

\comment{PREVIOUSLY: The conditions \( S^{-1}S = I \) and \( \beta_{1} = 0 \) as proved in Theorem~XX lead to \( \beta_{1} = \beta^{-1}_{1} = 0 \) and hence methods \( S \) and \( S^{-1} \) are basically of order zero. This could lead to difficulties in some numerical calculations especially if the discontinuous initial data are taken into account.}

In order to overcome this problem and achieve ``bona fide'' effective order SSPRK methods we need to choose different starting and finishing methods. In the construction of \( SM^{n}S^{-1} \) Runge-Kutta schemes, we consider \( P = SM \) and \( T = MS^{-1} \) as starting and finishing methods, respectively. Then the scheme becomes \( PM^{n-2}T \), where the order conditions of methods \( P \) and \( T \) are those of \( SM \) and \( MS^{-1} \), respectively.
%Hence, the new starting and finishing methods belong in the equivalent class of methods \( SM \) and \( MS^{-1} \), respectively.
In practice, the new starting and finishing methods must be equivalent to \( SM \) and \( MS^{-1} \), respectively, up to order $q$.
 In other words if \( \rho \) and \( \tau \) are the corresponding functions in group $G_1$ of methods \( P \) and \( T \), then
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:PT_OCs}
\begin{align}
    \rho(t) &= \alpha\beta(t), \quad \text{for all trees $t$ with $r(t) \leq q$,} \\
%\end{align}
%and
%\begin{align}
    \tau(t) &= \beta^{-1}\alpha(t), \quad \text{for all trees $t$ with $r(t) \leq q$,}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
and the scheme \( PM^{n-2}T \) is a method of classical order \( q \).


\comment{
\begin{displaymath}
    \rho \in \beta\alpha(1 + H_{q})
\end{displaymath}
and
\begin{displaymath}
    \tau \in \alpha\beta^{-1}(1 + H_{q}),
\end{displaymath}
where \( q \) is the effective order of method \( M \). In this case,
\begin{displaymath}
    \begin{split}
        (\beta\alpha\beta^{-1})^{n} &\in E^{n}(1 + H_{q}) \\
        \beta\alpha^{n}\beta^{-1} &\in E(1 + H_{q}) \\
        \beta\alpha\alpha^{n-2}\alpha\beta^{-1} &\in E(1 + H_{q}) \\
        \rho\alpha^{n-2}\tau &\in E(1 + H_{q}),
    \end{split}
\end{displaymath}
and the scheme \( PM^{n-2}T \) is an SSP method of classical order \( q \).}


\subsubsection{Finding starting methods $ R $ and $ T $}\label{subsection3.2.3}

%Description of optimization of R and T.

The order conditions from \eqref{eq:PT_OCs} do not contradict the SSP
requirements.  We can thus use the optimization procedure described in
Section~\ref{subsection3.1.1} with these order conditions instead of
the $\Phi_{p,q}$ in \eqref{eqSSPopt}.  \colincomment{Need some sort of
  summary here I suppose about number of stages, etc as above}


\subsection{Resulting schemes}

In this section, we present several ESSPRK methods and their starting
and stopping methods, given in the form of
Section~\ref{subsection3.2.2}.

Note that the starting and stopping schemes are not stationary.  If
accurate values are needed at any time other than the final time, the
computation must invoke the stopping method, and then the starting method to start up again. \todo{This should be explained earlier too, with just special notice here because its $RT$ not $SS^{-1}$}
