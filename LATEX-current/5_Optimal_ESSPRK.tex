\section{Optimal effective order explicit SSP Runge--Kutta schemes}\label{sec:optimal_ESSPRK}
In this section, we use the SSP theory and Butcher's theory of effective
order (Sections \ref{sec:SSP} and \ref{sec:Algebraic_RK}) to find
optimal explicit SSP Runge--Kutta schemes with prescribed effective
order and classical order.
According to Theorem~\ref{cor:no_SSP_5}, there are no SSPRK methods of
effective order five, and therefore we need only consider methods with
effective order up to four.

Recall from Section~\ref{sec:Algebraic_RK} that the methods of
effective order involve a main method $M$ as well as starting and
stopping methods $S$ and $S^{-1}$.
It turns out that methods $S$ and $S^{-1}$ are not generally SSP, but
we show below in Section~\ref{subsec:starting_stopping} how to modify
the procedure to fix this issue.

We denote by ESSPRK($s,q,p$) an $s$--stage explicit SSP Runge--Kutta 
method of effective order $q$ and classical order $p$.
Also we write SSPRK($s,q$) for a  $s$-stage explicit SSP Runge--Kutta 
method of order $q$.

\subsection{The main method}\label{subsec:main_method}

Our search for methods of effective order is carried out in two
steps, first searching for optimal main methods $M$ and then for
possible corresponding methods $S$ and $S^{-1}$.
For a given number of stages, effective order, and classical order,
our aim is thus to find an optimal main method, meaning one with the 
largest possible SSP coefficient $\sspcoef$.

To find a method ESSPRK($s,q,p$) with Butcher tableau $(A, \bm{b},
\bm{c})$, we consider the optimization problem~\eqref{eq:SSP_opt} 
with $\Phi(K)$ representing the conditions for effective order
$q$ and classical order $p$ (as per Table~\ref{tab:effective_OCs}).
The methods are found through numerical search, using 
\textsc{Matlab}'s optimization toolbox.
Specifically, we use \texttt{fmincon} with a sequential quadratic 
programming approach \cite{Ketcheson2008, Ketcheson/Macdonald/Gottlieb:2009}.
This process does not guarantee a global minimizer, so many searches 
from random initial guesses are performed to help ensure the method with
%\colintodo{Yiannis, I said ``try/attempt/help ensure'' because one cannot guarantee global optimality using a local optimizer.}
the largest possible SSP coefficient is found.

\subsubsection{Optimal SSP coefficients}\label{subsubsec:optimal_SSP_coeff}
The effective SSP coefficients for methods with up to eleven stages are shown in 
Table~\ref{tab:eff_SSP_coeff}.
%Since the effective order $q$ SSPRK methods (accompanied with relevant
%starting and stopping methods) are used in a scheme that attains classical
%order equal to $q$, it is reasonable to compare them to the SSPRK($s,q$)
%methods.
The ESSPRK($s,q,p$) methods form a super class of the SSPRK($s,q$)
methods and thus their SSP coefficients $\sspcoef$ must be greater
than or equal to that of SSPRK($s,q$) methods.
This is confirmed by comparing Table~\ref{tab:eff_SSP_coeff} with
\cite[Table~5]{Ketcheson/Macdonald/Gottlieb:2009}.
Recall from Section~\ref{subsec:Optimal_SSPRK} that $\clin$ (the SSP
coefficient for linear constant-coefficients problems) gives known
upper bound on the SSP coefficient \cite{Kraaijevanger1986, ketcheson2009a}.
Based on this we have the following result:
\begin{result}
	With a few exceptions, the ESSPRK($s,q,p$) methods
	found by numerical search are optimal because they have SSP coefficients
	$\sspcoef$ which achieve known values of $\clin$.
\end{result}

\subsubsection{Effective order three methods}\label{subsubsec:3rd_ESSPRK}
Table~\ref{tab:eff_SSP_coeff} shows that ESSPRK($s,3,2$) are 
optimal because they match the linear bounds. 
Note however that these bounds are also attained by SSPRK($s,3$) methods 
up to 11 stages. 
In the cases of three and four stages, we were able to determine closed-form 
families of solutions.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:ESSPRK(3,3,2)}
	A family of optimal three-stage, effective order three SSP Runge--Kutta 
	methods of classical order two, with SSP coefficient $\sspcoef=1$, is given by
    \begin{displaymath}
    		\begin{split}
    			\bm{Y}_1 &= \bm{u}^n \\
    			\bm{Y}_2 &= \bm{u}^n + \Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_1) \\
    			\bm{Y}_3 &= \bm{u}^n + \gamma\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_1) + \gamma\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_2) \\
    			\bm{u}^{n+1} &= \bm{u}^n + \frac{5\gamma-1}{6\gamma}\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_1) + \frac{1}{6}\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_2) + \frac{1}{6\gamma}\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_3),
        \end{split}
    \end{displaymath}
    where $1/4 \leq \gamma \leq 1$ is a free parameter. We denote the above family as 
    ESSPRK($3,3,2$).
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:ESSPRK(4,3,2)}
	An optimal family of four-stage, effective order three SSP Runge--Kutta 
	methods of classical order two, with SSP coefficient $\sspcoef=2$ is given by
    \begin{displaymath}
    		\begin{split}
    			\bm{Y}_1 &= \bm{u}^n \\
    			\bm{Y}_2 &= \bm{u}^n + \frac{1}{2}\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_1) \\
    			\bm{Y}_3 &= \bm{u}^n + \frac{1}{2}\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_1) + \frac{1}{2}\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_2) \\
    			\bm{Y}_4 &= \bm{u}^n + \gamma\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_1) + \gamma\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_2) + + \gamma\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_3) \\
    			\bm{u}^{n+1} &= \bm{u}^n + \frac{8\gamma-1}{12\gamma}\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_1) + \frac{1}{6}\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_2) + \frac{1}{6}\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_3) + \frac{1}{12\gamma}\Dt\bm{F}(\bm{Y}_4),
        \end{split}
    \end{displaymath}
    where $ 1/6 \leq \gamma \leq 1/2 $ is a free parameter. We denote the 
    above family as ESSPRK($4,3,2$).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	In either theorem, feasibility can be verified by direct calculation of the 
	conditions in problem~\eqref{eq:SSP_opt}. Optimality follows because 
	the families achieve the appropriate linear bound.
\end{proof}

Theorem~\ref{thm:ESSPRK(3,3,2)} gives a \emph{family} of three-stage 
methods. 
The particular value of $\gamma = 1/4$ corresponds to the classical
Shu--Osher SSPRK($3,3$) method \cite{Gottlieb/Shu:1998}.
Similarly, in Theorem~\ref{thm:ESSPRK(4,3,2)} the particular value of 
$\gamma = 1/6$ corresponds to the usual SSPRK($4,3$) method.
It seems possible that for each number of stages, the 
ESSPRK($s, 3, 2$) methods may form a family in which an optimal 
SSPRK($s$, $3$) method is a particular member. 

\subsubsection{Effective order four methods}\label{subsubsec:4th_ESSPRK}
For effective order four, the ESSPRK($s,4,p$) methods can have
classical order $p=2$ or $3$.
%These methods have an SSP coefficient $\sspcoef$ which is at least as
%large as SSPRK($s, 4$) (in fact, they are all larger except in the
%case where $s =10$ where they are equal).\davidtodo{See my comment above.}
In either case, for $7 \le s \le 11$ stages the methods found are
optimal because the SSP coefficient attains the upper bound of
$\clin$.
For fewer stages, the ESSPRK methods still have SSP coefficients up to
30\% larger than that of explicit SSPRK($s,q$) methods.
% the SSP coefficient of ESSPRK($s,4,2$) and
%ESSPRK($s,4,3$) are the same and both achieve the linear bound
%$\clin$.
%ESSPRK($6,4,2$) is also optimal.
In the particular case of four-stage methods we have the following result:
\begin{result}
	In contrast with the non-existence of an SSPRK(4,\,4) method 
	\cite{Gottlieb/Shu:1998,Ruuth2002}, 
	we are able to find ESSPRK(4,\,4,\,2) and ESSPRK(4,\,4,\,3) methods.
	The coefficients of these methods are found in
	Tables~\ref{tab:ESSPRK(4,4,2)_scheme}
	and~\ref{tab:ESSPRK(4,4,3)_scheme}.
\end{result}

\subsection{Starting and stopping methods}\label{subsec:starting_stopping}
Having constructed an ESSPRK($s,q,p$) scheme that can be used as the main 
method $M$, we want to find perturbation methods $S$ and $S^{-1}$ such that the 
Runge--Kutta scheme $S^{-1}MS$ attains classical order $q$, equal to the 
effective order of method $M$.
We also want the resulting overall process to be SSP.
If method $S$ advances the solution in time, then $S^{-1}$ must evolve the 
solution backward in time, which may be undesirable in some cases. 
For this reason, starting and stopping methods $S, S^{-1}$ are usually 
designed to perturb the solution but not advance in time. 
A drawback of this approach is that the resulting $S$ (and $S^{-1}$) scheme 
is not SSP:
the condition $\beta_1 = 0$ (i.e., $\sum_i b_i = 0$) implies negative
weights and thus the scheme cannot be SSP.
The overall $S^{-1}M^nS$ method will therefore also not be SSP.

In order to overcome this problem and achieve ``bona fide'' effective order 
SSPRK methods we need to choose different starting and stopping methods. 
We consider methods $R$ and $T$ which each take a positive step such that 
$R \equival{q} MS$ and $T \equival{q} S^{-1}M$.
That is, the order conditions of $R$ and $T$ must match those of
$MS$ and $S^{-1}M$, respectively, up to order $q$.
This gives a new $TM^{n-2}R$ method which is equivalent up to order $q$ 
to the $S^{-1}M^nS$ method and attains classical order $q$.
The starting and stopping procedures now each take a positive step forward 
in time.

To derive order conditions for the $R$ and $T$ methods, consider their
corresponding functions in group $G$ to be $\rho$ and $\tau$
respectively.
Then the equivalence is expressed as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:R_T_OCs}
    \rho(t) = (\beta\alpha)(t) \text{ and } \tau(t) = (\alpha\beta^{-1})(t), \quad \text{for all 
    trees $t$ with $r(t) \leq q$.}
\end{equation}
%and equivalently,
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:RMT_OCs}
%    \rho\alpha\tau(t) = E^3(t), \quad \text{for all trees $t$ with $r(t) \leq q$.}
%\end{equation}
Rewriting the second condition in \eqref{eq:R_T_OCs} as 
$(\tau\beta)(t) = \alpha(t)$, the order conditions for the starting and stopping 
methods can be determined and are given in Table~\ref{tab:rho_tau_OCs}.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{lcl}
		\hline
    		\multicolumn{1}{c}{$\rho(t) = (\beta\alpha)(t)$} & & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$(\tau\beta)(t) = \alpha(t)$} \\

		$\rho_8 = \alpha_8 + \alpha_1\beta_4 + \alpha_2\beta_2 + \beta_8$ & & $\tau_8 = \alpha_8 - \alpha_1\beta_4 - \alpha_2\beta_2 + \beta_2^2 -  \beta_8$

  		and stopping methods $R$ and $T$, respectively.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Optimizing the staring and stopping methods}\label{subsubsec:opt_methods}
It turns out that the order conditions from \eqref{eq:R_T_OCs} do not
contradict the SSP requirements.
We can thus find methods $R$ and $T$ using the optimization procedure
described in Section~\ref{subsec:Optimal_SSPRK} with the order conditions 
given by Table~\ref{tab:rho_tau_OCs} for $\Phi(K)$ in \eqref{eq:SSP_opt}.
in \eqref{eq:SSP_opt}.
\colintodo{I see a change has been made here: Yiannis: are you sure these are correct?  Should I double-check them?}
\yiannistodo{The table as it is now is correct. I double-check it once more at a latter stage.}

For a given main method $M$, the values of $\alpha_i$ are already known.
Also note that for effective order $q$, the algebraic expressions on
$\beta$ up to order $q-1$ are already found by the optimization procedure of 
the main method (see Table~\ref{tab:effective_OCs}). 
However, the values of the order $q$ elementary weights on $\beta$ are not 
known; these are $\beta_3$ and $\beta_4$ for effective order three and
$\beta_5$, $\beta_6$, $\beta_7$ and $\beta_8$ for effective order four.
From Table~\ref{tab:rho_tau_OCs}, we see that both the $R$ and $T$
methods depend on these parameters.
Our approach is to optimize for both methods at once: we solve a
modified version of the optimization problem \eqref{eq:SSP_opt} where
we simultaneously maximize both SSP coefficients subject to the
constraints given in \eqref{eq:R_T_OCs} and conditions on $\beta$ given by 
Table~\ref{tab:effective_OCs}. 
The unknown elementary weights on $\beta$ are used as free parameters.
In practice, we maximize the objective function $\min(r_1,r_2)$, where $r_1$ 
and $r_2$ are the absolute radii of monotonicity of the two Runge--Kutta 
methods.

We were able to construct starting and stopping schemes for each main 
method, with an SSP coefficient at least as large as that of the main method.
For each order, effective order and number of stages the computational cost
of the starting and stopping methods is kept low. 
In particular, for methods $R$ and $T$ associated with an $s$-stage main method,
at most $s + 1$ and $s$ stages are required.
%In some stages better results are obtained, for example if the main method is 
%ESSPRK($3,3,2$), then its relative starting and stopping methods have only three 
%stages.
\sout{
For a main method of classical order two, the starting and stopping schemes 
themselves are first order accurate, whereas for classical order three they 
achieve second order accuracy.
